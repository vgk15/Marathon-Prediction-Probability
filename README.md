Project Title: **Marathon Prediction Probability**

**Project Description:** This project uses real-world data from the 2019 Boston Marathon to predict whether a runner will finish in the top 25% based solely on their age. After cleaning and engineering age-based features, a Random Forest classifier is trained and tuned using cross-validation. The model's performance is evaluated using ROC AUC curve and key visualizations are generated to interpret results. This kind of model could be valuable for platforms like Strava or Garmin to personalize training insights or athlete performance across age groups.

**Dependencies:**
Install requirements using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
